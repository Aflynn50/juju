	// None of these hooks are ever associated with a relation; each of them
	// represents a change to the state of the unit as a whole. The values
	// themselves are all valid hook names.

	// In normal operation, a unit will run at least the `install`, `start`, `config-changed`
	// and `stop` hooks over the course of its lifetime.

	// The `install` hook always runs once, and only once, before any other hook.
	Install Kind = "install"

	// The `start` hook always runs once immediately after the first config-changed
	// hook. Also, on kubernetes charms, whenever a unitâ€™s pod churns, `start` will
	// be fired again on that unit.
	Start Kind = "start"

	// The `config-changed` hook always runs once immediately after the install hook,
	// and likewise after the upgrade-charm hook. It also runs whenever the service
	// configuration changes, and when recovering from transient unit agent errors.
	ConfigChanged Kind = "config-changed"

	// The `upgrade-charm` hook always runs once immediately after the charm directory
	// contents have been changed by an unforced charm upgrade operation, and *may* do
	// so after a forced upgrade; but will *not* be run after a forced upgrade from an
	// existing error state. (Consequently, neither will the config-changed hook that
	// would ordinarily follow the upgrade-charm.)
	UpgradeCharm Kind = "upgrade-charm"

	// The `stop` hook is the last hook to be run before the unit is destroyed. In the
	// future, it may be called in other situations.
	Stop Kind = "stop"

	// kinds represent will be prefixed by the relation name; for example,

	RelationJoined Kind = "relation-joined"

	// The "relation-changed" hook for a given unit always runs once immediately
	// following the relation-joined hook for that unit, and subsequently whenever
	// the related unit changes its settings (by calling relation-set and exiting
	// without error). Note that "immediately" only applies within the context of
	// this particular runtime relation -- that is, when "foo-relation-joined" is
	// run for unit "bar/99" in relation id "foo:123", the only guarantee is that
	// the next hook to be run *in relation id "foo:123"* will be "foo-relation-changed"
	// for "bar/99". Unit hooks may intervene, as may hooks for other relations,
	// and even for other "foo" relations.
	RelationChanged Kind = "relation-changed"

	// The "relation-departed" hook for a given unit always runs once when a related
	// unit is no longer related. After the "relation-departed" hook has run, no
	// further notifications will be received from that unit; however, its settings
	// will remain accessible via relation-get for the complete lifetime of the
	// relation.
	RelationDeparted Kind = "relation-departed"

	// The "relation-broken" hook is not specific to any unit, and always runs once
	// when the local unit is ready to depart the relation itself. Before this hook
	// is run, a relation-departed hook will be executed for every unit known to be
	// related; it will never run while the relation appears to have members, but it
	// may be the first and only hook to run for a given relation. The stop hook will
	// not run while relations remain to be broken.
