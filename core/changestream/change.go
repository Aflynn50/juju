// Change types represent the internal type of change that has occurred.
// These are not exposed publicly, this is by design, to prevent watchers
// expecting a unique create event over a update event. This can lead to
// faulty assumptions about the underlying data.
//
// Although, create and update are two separate types, they are combined
// to represent a change in the underlying type. A update will always supersede
// an update, and it is indicative of a change in the underlying type. A delete
// is a separate type as it represents a deletion of the underlying type and
// will supersede a create or update.
