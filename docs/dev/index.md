This documentation is aimed at Juju developers or Juju users who would like to see what's under the hood.
It is not intended to stand on its own but merely to supplement the [Juju documentation](https://juju.is/docs/olm) and
the [Charm SDK documentation](https://juju.is/docs/sdk). Note also that many of our Juju developer docs are still just
on [GitHub](https://github.com/juju/juju/tree/3.6/doc). <!-- TODO: This link and references may be not that useful since we are migrating this doc to Github :) -->
